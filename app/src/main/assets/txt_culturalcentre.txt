The Phantom of the Opera, Les Misérables, Miss Saigon… These are just some of the internationally renowned productions that have graced the stages of the Hong Kong Cultural Centre. Housed right by the harbourfront on the tip of Kowloon peninsula, this structure is one of the premier venues for a wide array of cultural performances. 

A highlight here is the oval-shaped Concert Hall, which houses one of the largest mechanically operated pipe organs in the region. Meanwhile, the three-tiered Grand Theatre regularly hosts ballets, operas and musicals.
